# react-todo-intro

A simple React app built with `next.js` to demonstrate some of the basic mechanics of a React app

# Setup

This repo is using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started) to sketch out a simple React application. To run the app, simply clone it and then:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each commit is designed to implement the next step in working towards the final goal: a todo list split across several components with different relationships to the underlying data (the list of todo items).

You can shuffle forward and back between commits in the repo using:
```
npm run forward   <- move to the next completed step
npm run back      <- move back to the previous commit
```
